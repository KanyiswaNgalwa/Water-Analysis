# Water Quality Analysis Dataset
 
## Overview

This dataset contains water quality measurements collected from various sampling points over a period from May 9, 2023, to November 28, 2023. The data includes various parameters such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and more.
 
## Data Collection

The data was collected from the following sampling points:

- **Puente Bilbao**

- **Arroyo Las Torres**

- **Puente Irigoyen**

- **Arroyo Salguero**

- **Puente Falbo**
 
### Methods of Collection

The data was gathered through direct sampling at specified times and dates. The parameters measured include:
